no_schools_desc;There's no organized school system or budget for education. The scarce literacy gain that is achieved comes from religious schools or it is based on informal community teaching, though these places get some funding, indirectly, from the government. Higher education institutions are either non existent or completely religious and medieval.\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_schools_desc;A rudimentary school system exists in the capital and a few important cities but enrollment is completely optional. Schools limits themselves to teaching pupils how to read and write. There's no government agency to inspect schools and they have no common standards for teaching, with the few courses that exist being overcrowded. Private schools are commonly in the same conditions. Teachers don't have professional formation and are often just literate men, while pupils often leave school without being properly schooled.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 30%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

acceptable_schools_desc;Schools can be found in every major and most of the medium cities. A government agency exists to ensure quality standards in education and to inspect that proper facilities are used for it. Enrollment is encouraged and sometimes it's outright mandatory, but it's not properly enforced and pupils often don't go to school for a variety of reasons. Children are also taught math and a few other subjects. Education institutions for teenagers are starting to appear, and secular, higher education institutions for adults are common. Teachers are formally trained, but oftentimes poorly.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 40%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

good_schools_desc;Schools can be found in almost every city. Government agencies take education with the utmost seriousness, and enrollment is mandatory and tightly controlled. Children and teenagers are taught a variety of subjects besides reading and writing and teachers are taught pedagogy during their formation. Literacy campaigns for adults and the elderly are a part of the government's effort to eradicate illiteracy. Higher education institutions are considered good, with opportunities for the poor classes to enroll.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded education provides a bonus to this reform.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyzer) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPEEDEXPLAINED;So, in case you've been having problems with game speed, this event is for you. You may have already seen the performance submod that decreases terrain texture resolution for that purpose. Another thing can be done to increase performance, however it is a bit more difficult. \n 1. Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\GFM\settings.txt \n 2. Find "update_time = 1.00000" in the file \n 3. Change it to "update_time = 100.00000" \n The issue with this is that it undoes itself every time you restart the game, so you either need to do it every time you start, or you can set the file to read only, however this makes the game unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

APRILUPRISING;Chaos reigns in Bulgaria as villages explode into revolt left and right. The Bulgarians' 480-year slumber has ended, and their awakening has sent us into a waking nightmare. An open revolt has begun, planned out by the secret Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. The uprising has been divided into 4 seperate revolutionary districts with seperate command structures. Expat brigades of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee have crossed the Romanian border to aid their compatriots. Suffice to say fighting through every mountain village will be a bloody and protracted conflict, sure to attract the eyes of the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYLETTER;Brothers! \nYesterday, Neceb Aga came from Plovdiv to our village and demanded imprisoning several people, including me. I called up some brave men and after getting armed, we headed towards the konak and attacked it, killing the governor and some policemen. Now, as I write this letter, the flag waves before the konak, rifles shoot and the church bells echo simultaneously with them and men are kissing one another on the streets. If you, brothers, happen to be true patriots and apostles of freedom, then do follow our example in Panagyurishte. Koprivshtitsa, 20th April 1876 T. Kableshkov \n\nThe so-called 'Bloody Letter' was written in the blood of a local governor murdered by Bulgarian revolutionary Todor Kableshkov in an uprising. It has kicked off unrest across Bulgaria. We can only hope it doesn't get out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATAKMASSACRE;Ahmet Aga, the Ottoman commander, had surrounded the village and said that he wanted all arms laid down. Trendafil, the rebel leader, went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him. I heard Ahmet Aga command for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. His words were "Shishak aor" which is Turkish for "to put on a skewer". They took all his money, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth, impaled him slowly on a stake and roasted him. I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women, surrounded by Bashi-Bazuk who forced us to watch what was happening. One of the children, Vladimir, still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her. Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me. Trendafil's burnt bones stood there for a month before being buried. \n\nOttoman irregulars have massacred the inhabitants of the village of Batak, the last holdout of the Bulgarian rebels. They did so independently of high command, but the international community is in uproar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31716;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31716;Work on the foundation of the Eiffel Tower is complete. The construction of the legs facing the the south and east were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The other two, however, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated. Each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15m (49 ft) long and 6m (20 ft) in diameter, driven to a depth of 22m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs support a block built of limestone, each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. The shoes are anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. \n\nThe laying of the ironwork for the tower's body can now begin, though we must set an appropriate budget for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31717;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31717;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from L'Independent and La Vanguardia completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large Catalan flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The crowd were enraged by rumours that the balloon was not the largest and newest of Coxwell's balloons. As tensions ran high, a woman was allegedly struck by a police officer trying to defend the balloon from the crowd, causing a riot. Coxwell's balloon was torn to shreds by the crowds, which caused the gas envelope to collapse as he fled, under attack from the crowd. The event set back scientific progress in the field of high-level flight and was of great expense to Coxwell who had to build a replacement balloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC18481984;We agreed in the Treaty of 1843 to never take possession of any parts of the Hawaiian domain, but French colonists and merchants continue to clamor for annexing Hawaii into our empire. Added to our ordeal over this "Hawaiian Question" is the persecution of French Catholics, whom we ought to avenge. Gillaume Patrice Dillon, the current consul in Hawaii, despite having previously been given orders by us not to display any "pugnaciousness," agrees that a show of force is necessary against the Hawaiians. He writes that "it will prove sufficient to display a good French corvette for three days at Honolulu to force concessions from this devious and hypocritical Government." Admiral Louis Tromelin, who is currently anchored in Honolulu, has proposed sending a list of demands that would protect Catholics and increase our economic influence under the threat of invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHHAWDEMANDS;France has sent a frigate under Admiral Louis Tromelin to deliver us a list of demands: the reduction of import duties on French brandy, the immunity of Catholic missionaries to our laws, the use of French as the language of communication between France and Hawaii, and the punishing of schoolboys who misbehave in Catholic churches.

If we nationalize and officialize the currency, commerce within our state and with the world would be more accessible and regulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPAFORCEDCONSTITUTION;The Spanish Constitution of 1845 would replace the Constitution of 1837, reverting many liberties granted for it. In May 1844 General Ramón María Narváez took over the government, the moderates were divided on the need to reform the 1837 Constitution then in force - even the most reactionary group led by the Marquis de Viluma advocated its repeal and the return to the charter granted by the Royal Statute of 1834. Narváez finally leaned towards the option of the reform defended by the group led by Alejandro Mon and Pedro José Pidal against the group of moderate "puritans" who defended its maintenance because its approval had been the result of consensus between the two large liberal parties, moderate and progressive, which would allow them to alternate in government without having to change the Constitution every time the government is changed. Our Queen, even if you are 14 years old, we have to ask: do you accept the new constitution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31723;News has reached us that engagements between rebel troops under General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan and government troops have started in the town of Vicálvaro. The rebels demand the restoration of the 1837 Constitution which granted electoral and individual rights but was too liberal for our Queen, getting replaced in 1845 by a more conservative constitution. The rebels are well armed and fight with tenacity and hope, believing that they can overthrow the government and restore rights to the citizenry. Do we avoid more bloodshed and restore the constitution of 1837 or fight for our control over Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31724;The rebels under General Leopoldo O'Donnell have advanced into Madrid after defeating government forces in the town of Vicálvaro. Rebels are rising in other parts of Spain and are have gathered to surround Madrid. Do we continue fighting and hope for the best or give in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31725;Today our troops in the defence of Madrid have been victorious, and revolts in other parts of Spain are being put down by our glorious troops, defending our prestigious monarchy. Our country is in ruins and our people is tired of war, but Espartero escaped encirclement, alone with his horse, and retired to the countryside, where we hope he will die and dissapear from history. After all this bloodshed, we could try to calm our population, but doing so would also anger the reactionaries, which would search for rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31726;After a bloody war against the Carlists, pacts with them have been conducted in Lécera to establish the conditions of treatment of prisoners of war and regularization of exchanges, similar to the Elliot Convention in 1835.

EVTDESC31727;Today a revolt started in Barcelona against the government of Joaquín María López, who has breached the agreements with the Central Board for the overthrow of the government of Espartero, produced a few weeks earlier and in violation of various provisions in the 1837 constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We can't let the federalists seize our precious lands, sweep away our traditions and way of life, destroy our economy, or even letting them capture our beloved capital for them to establish a corrupt democracy. We could spy them to prevent rebellion, but it's too late to fully prevent it. Do we disarm them by force or ignore the danger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31730;Today engagements around the country are starting, and our forces are preparing for an impending civil war. Our people will have to suffer over it, or do we let them live in peace, and have all those "liberties" they want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31738;All insurrections have been put down, and our defence of Madrid is victorious. We hope a similar escenario never happens again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUINTESSPA1845;A rebellion has started in Catalonia against the newly applied Quintes system which bases recruitment on needed troops. It divides conscription by town based on population. The old Catalan conscription system is one of the only Catalan ways of governance seperate from those of the rest of Spain that wasn't abolished in the Nueva Planta Decrees in the 1720s. The Catalan populace doesn't want to fight for a country that they think oppresses them. We haven't got many troops to spare as they're defending our homeland from the liberals. What do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUINTESSPA1870;Today a rebellion has started in Catalonia against the newly applied Quintes system, which based recruitment on needed troops, partitioned by the towns, based on their population, as it's one of the only things that weren't abolished in the Nueva Planta Decrees in the 1720s, and the Catalan populace doesn't want to fight for a country that they think oppresses them. We haven't got many troops spared, as they're defending our homeland from the conservatives, what do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31741;Today, Barcelona-based Swiss industrialist Hans Gamper has founded what will end up being Futbol Club Barcelona, along with a handful of sports enthusiasts, mainly foreigners, who gathered at Gimnàs Solé after their integration into Català FC was rejected. . The founders included the club's first players: Walter Wild, Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Künzli, Otto Maier, Enrique Ducay, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31742;The lower house of the Spanish Parliament approved the creation of a Commonwealth today, but with limited powers compared to those originally envisioned for it by its promoters. On 18 December 1913 the king signed the law granting all Spanish provinces the right to group themselves into associations or commonwealths, Catalonia being the only commonwealth so planned. The first President of the Commonwealth of Catalonia will be, if done, Enric Prat de la Riba, of the Lliga Regionalista, who will led a programme to create an efficient infrastructure of roads and ports, hydraulic works, railways, telephones, charities and healthcare. The Commonwealth also wants to undertook initiatives to increase agricultural and forest yields, introducing technological improvements, the improvement of services and education, and promoting education in technologies necessary for Catalan industry. The last decision is for the Spanish Senate, which depends on us to finish their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31743;'Spaniards: The enthusiastic welcome that the Liberal Army found in the villages, so heroically shown in Vicálvaro, the applause with which the news of our patriotic uprising has been received everywhere, they assure from now on the triumph of the freedom which we have sworn to defend. In a few days most of the provinces will have shaken the tyrants, the nation will enjoy the benefits of the representative regime. It is time, then, to say what we are determined to do in the matter of victory. We want the preservation of the throne, the rigorous practice of the fundamental laws, tax cuts, we want to uproot the peoples from that centralization, giving them the local independence necessary to preserve their culture, and as a guarantee of all this we want and raise, under solid foundations, the National Militia. These are our attempts, which we express frankly, without imposing them on the nation. We'll lay the definitive foundations of liberal regeneration to which we aspire. We have our swords consecrated to the national will, and we will not sheath them until it is fulfilled.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31744;Inspired by Espartero's patriotic federalist manifesto, the people have risen up against our government and surrounded the King's Palace, forcing us to agree to an armistice and negotiate peace. As we lack support of the populace and the necessary soldiers, the only thing we can do is give the rebels what they want and stop the bloodshed that has struck our great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31745;3 days ago a draft constitution was presented to the progressive parliament and approved. This constitution follows a strongly progressive and liberal ideology, reaffirming the principle of national sovereignty in an absolute way. All institutions, including the Crown, would find their foundation in the will of the Nation, it would also grant a wide range of political rights and install, for the first time in Spain, a religiously tolerant system of governance. Its articulation is broader and more complete than that contained in the Constitution of 1837 and the Constitution of 1845. It is a rigid constitution, as it establishes a rather tedious reform procedure. Regardless, yesterday, General Leopoldo O'Donnell staged a counter-revolution, launching a coup that has put and end to the progressive biennium. He has decreed the closure of the Constituent Assembly elected in 1854 and cancelled the Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEGREATGATSBY;The Great Gatsby, a book by Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, has been published today. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald and he incorporated aspects of it into the novel. This tragic work of literature is one of the best of the genre and is sure to remain a classic for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHARLESLINDFLIGHT;Charles Lindbergh, an obscure air mail pilot, made history today by completing the first solo flight over the Atlantic from Roosevelt Field, Long Island, to Le Bourget Aerodrome, Paris, in his purpose-built, single-engine Ryan monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis. His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of fuel that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed 2.7 tons (2329 kilograms), with takeoff hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindbergh's monoplane was powered by a J-5C Wright Whirlwind radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52 AM takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field by about twenty feet. Over the next 33 and a half hours, Lindbergh and the Spirit faced many challenges, which included skimming over storm clouds at 10,000ft (3,000m) and wave tops at as low as 10ft (3m). He landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome at 10:22 PM on Saturday, May 21st. A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and carried him around above their heads for 'nearly half an hour'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

raise_militia_desc;Our country is too small to raise a regular army, yet we desperately need armed forces. Conscripting peasants into an improvised irregular militia will result in a very disorganized and unprofessional force, but that will have to do.

EVTDESC16121916;A team of 12 fearless mountaineers and 60 porters travelled to the foot of Mount Everest and set up a base camp to prepare an ascent. This Mount Everest expedition of 1924 is our second attempt to reach the top of the world after the failure two years prior. Both expeditions have been financed by the Royal Geographical Society, the Alpine Club, and a major contribution by Captain John Noel. After two summit attempts had to be broken off despite setting a world altitude record of 28,126 feet (8572 m), the mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew "Sandy" Irvine set out on a third and final bid for the peak - and were never seen again. The last sighting was Noel Odell's claim to have watched two black dots on the 2nd step (cliff face) of the Northeast ridge, ascending it in roughly 5 minutes. Nobody knows whether they reached the peak before perishing. Today, the surviving expedition members erected a memorial cairn in honour of the men who never returned from Mount Everest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LEMANSSTARTS;Today the first '24 Hours of Le Mans' race has taken place, running along public roads near the name-giving city. It is planned to be a three-year event, the winner being declared by which driver could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, being awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Triennial Cup. For now, winners who covered the largest distance in a single 24-hour race are declared annually. Twenty car manufacturers constructed special racecars for the event, all from France aside from Bentley from Great Britain and Excelsior from Belgium. The victory in the first race went to the Chenard-Walcker team and their Bentley. Although they were delayed by stones smashing a headlight and puncturing the fuel tank, in the end the team of René Léonard / André Lagache and Christian Dauvergne / Raoul Bachmann won a comfortable 1–2 victory. The race has been an excellent exhibition of machine endurance and reliability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOUBAGHLAREVOLT;An insurrection has begun in the mountains surrounding in Benni Abbes against our colonial rule. Intense unrest among Maghrebis and Berbers in the region has lead to civilians supplying the rebels. Chérif Boubaghla, a skilled guerilla tactician, is at the head of the insurrection, organizing the mountains tribes into raiding parties who ambush our forces and vanish again like strokes of lightning. Today, an attack on Chellata wreaked havoc on the local administration. Sheriff Benali, chief of the Zaouia of Chelatta has reproached our forces for failing to prevent Boubaghla's attack, deciding to join him in rebellion. If we don't do anything, more and more chieftains will begin joining the revolt. The battle for Kabylia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONAGARFIELD;James A. Garfield, 20th president of the United States, has been shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C.. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on for his summer vacation, which was reported in the Washington newspaper. Charles J. Guiteau, a mentally ill lawyer who was fantasizing about Garfield being politically indebted to him therefore knew to lay in wait at the train station, preparing to shoot him. At 9:30AM, as Garfield entered the station's waiting room, Guiteau stepped forward and shot him at point-blank range from behind. Garfield cried out, 'My God, what is that?', flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again, and Garfield collapsed. While Guiteau was quickly arrested, the president has been severly injured, suffering internal hemorrhaging. He will probably not survive to see the end of the year, and that after only having been president for four months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONWMCKINLEY;News has reached us that William McKinley, 25th president of the United States, was shot in the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He was shaking hands with the public when anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen. McKinley had attended the exhibition to hold speeches with the goal of convincing the attendees of the importance of protective tariffs. Aside from this official purpose, he also took time to enjoy the fair and meet fairgoers in scheduled public receptions such as the one at the Temple of Music that lead to the shooting. McKinley is currently in critical condition. Of the two bullets Czolgosz fired at him, one deflected off a button but the other penetrated his abdomen, lodging in his back. While the bullet itself is no longer dangerous now that it has stopped moving, its path through McKinley's gut is very concerning. If it gets infected, the president doesn't have much longer to live. While doctors are optimistic, McKinley's chances are slim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_title;The Iasi National Theatre;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_desc;The first building in Iasi arranged to host theater performances was the "Théâtre des Variétés" (Variety Theater) built in 1832. As the number of local or passing theatrical troupes increased, the building quickly became too small. Thus, the need for a grand theatre the likes of which is common in great European cities has arisen. Construction has been proposed to take place in the building which had served as palace to Ionita Sandu Sturdza, ruler of Moldavia from 1822 to 1828. Architect Alexandru Costinescu has made plans for refitting the ground floor into a huge amphitheater surrounded by three rows of loges and crowned with a gallery and large stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_npolarexp2_title;The German North Polar Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_npolarexp2_desc;August Petermann, an expert on cartography and geography has proposed an expedition to the North Pole at a Geographic assembly in Frankfurt organized by the 'Freier Deutscher Hochstift'. Petermann firmly believes in the questionable theory of the open polar sea, concluding that beyond a thin belt of drift ice, the sea surrounding the North Pole is itself devoid of ice. Although Petermann ambitiously hopes that the expedition might reach the pole after clearing the purported ice zone and reaching the open sea, it would still be of great academic value to explore and scientifically analyze the waters and islands of the far North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
challenger_exped_title;The Challenger Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
challenger_exped_desc;Charles Wyville Thomson, a Scottish natural historian and marine zoologist of the University of Edinburgh and member of the Royal Society of London has requested use of the HMS Challenger to make a scientific circumnavigation of the globe. Goals of the expedition include discovering new species of marine fauna and flora, conducting deep sea soundings, bottom dredges, open water trawls and serial water temperature observations and surveying and exploring antarctic waters. The ambitious 127,580km journey requiring a crew of 216 lead by 21 officers would certainly be arduous. Experts have predicted 'a great advance in the knowledge of our planet' would be reached by the expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He is working together with the Geographical Society of Brussels to raise funds but is still sorely in financing. Subsidizing the expedition would make Belgian national prestige involved in the undertaking and ensure that the potential scientific discoveries to be made in Antarctica would not fail due to lack of funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SISIASSASSINATION;60-year-old Empress Elisabeth, also popularly known as Sisi, traveled incognito to Geneva, where she had been invited to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage. After the death of her only son, Rudolf, in the so-called Mayerling Incident, where he commited murder-suicide together with his lover Baroness Mary Vetsera, she sank deep into melancholy. Elisabeth began wearing long black dresses and carried a white parasol, going on trips throughout Europe to distract herself from her misery. On the fateful day of her arrival in Geneva, as Elisabeth and her lady-in-waiting were walking along a promenade leading to a steamer which they intended to take to cross lake Geneva, 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them. After peering underneath the empress's parasol, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand as if he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, he stabbed Elisabeth with a four-inch-long sharpened needle file. She died shortly after boarding the steamer, having been Queen for 44 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HALIFAXEXPLOSION;This morning, the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with high explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the Mont-Blanc led to a massive explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax. 1,782 people have been killed, largely in Halifax and Dartmouth, by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others have been injured. This blast was the largest man-made explosion in history. Preliminary investigations have concluded that both ships were to blame for the collision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EUREKAREBELS;The Victorian gold rush began in 1851, bringing masses of migrants into the area to seek their fortune in the mines. The local government sought to profit from the boom by issuing a mining tax of 30 shillings a month. Furious gold miners organized in protest, eventually escalating to ten thousand people swearing allegiance to a newly proclaimed secessionist republic. The conflict erupted into battle when 280 soldiers engaged 190 miners, resulting in around 50 deaths and the arrest of the agitants. While the worst offenders are now behind bars and the secessionist sentiments have been quelled, this incident has still caught the attention of all of Australia, laying the seeds for future unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bomfim_mahdia_dispute_desc;In the early 19th century, a territorial dispute began between Portugal and the United Kingdom over the area between the watershed of the Amazon and the Essequibo surrounding the Maú River. Time and time again, tensions have risen over the area due to attempts by our or the British officials to extend administration to the territory, leading to a mutual acceptance of the status quo. Now, the time has come to definitively settle the issue. Proposing an arbitration by the king of Italy should win over the Brits and guarantee a fair outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DINGWUQIHUANG;A famine has lead to the death of about 10 million people - the most to die in a famine in the last 200 years - in the states of Shensi, Shansi, Honan and Shantung, causing huge economic and social downturn. The sale of wives and daughters into human trafficking has become common due to the chaos that has ravaged the region. Traffickers are reported to regularly drive groups of thousands of women South from the barren lands of Shansi and Honan to the East and South. The famine may be caused by opium plantations being placed where rice once grew, lowering rice output available to the populace combined with crop failure caused by a drought due to el Niño. Even a heart of stone should shed tears for the death that has struck us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Qihezhuo_Rebellion_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§W In 1830, Yusuf Khoja attempted to capture Yarkand from the Qing but was beaten back and forced to flee to our lands over the Tian Shan mountains. His revolt was the last in a long chain of conflicts in the region led by members of his bloodline. His oldest son, Yishanhan Khoja, has assumed the title of 'Kata Tiaole', grand prince of the Khojas. He is gathering forces in one last glorious attempt to capture Kashgar for islam but lacks funding. Sponsoring his holy war would be costly but hopefully a decisive blow against Qing rule in Sinkiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QIHEZHUOREBELLION;With support from the Khanate of Kokand, Kata Tiaole, the heir to the Khoja dynasty which we drove from Sinkiang in 1759, has invaded over the mountains and captured the city of Kashgar. The Khojas have long been a thorn in our side, last invading the area in 1830. If we defeat them decisively here and now on the field of battle, we may be rid of them for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAGASAKIINCIDENT1;The Beiyang fleet docked in Nagasaki in a visit as part of their tour of various major Asian harbors as a show of force. 500 sailors took part in shore leave, going to the red-light district, where during an altercation with locals, they were blamed for damaged fixtures. Locals also claimed that drunken sailors went around the city pursuing women and children, causing an outrage. Nagasaki Prefecture Police Department tried to intervene together with a large number of local civilians. As a result, the policemen and sailors, using swords purchased from stores, began to fight hand-to-hand in sword battles within the city, causing at least 80 deaths. This is sure to cause diplomatic tensions with Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAVITEMUTINY;A dangerous trend in the Philippines has become apparent: the willingness for Filipinos to resist Spanish rule through armed revolt, including those in the colonial army and workforce. Today, around 200 Filipinos staged a mutiny in Cavite's San Felipe Fort. These rebels primarily were soldiers and laborers employed in the Cavite arsenal, the latter of whom deeply resented how their exemption from paying tribute to the Spanish government was revoked. Other grievances included the refusal by the Spanish to pay for tobacco from Filipino farmers as well as the use of forced labor. The mutiny, nevertheless, was unsuccessful, and our troops executed many of the participants. The Catholic priests turned mutiny leaders Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora--collectively known as Gomburza--have in particular become immortalized as martyrs after their execution, since the Filipinos assert these men were not given a fair trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_title;Shakespeare's Mission to Khiva;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_desc;Russia has long been scheming to conquer the Khanate of Khiva. While their last attempt in 1717 was pushed back, news has reached us of a large force gathering in Orenburg that is clearly being assembled for a march across the steppe into Khiva. Russia's primary justification for their aggression against the Khanate is their holding of many Russian fishermen captured from the eastern Caspian as slaves. Major d'Arcy Todd of our mission to Herat has suggested sending his political assistant, Richmond Campbell Shakespear, as an emissary to Khiva to attempt to convince the Khan to release the Russian slaves, thus removing the Russian pretext for war. However, we do not know whether Russia will already have inavaded Khiva by the time he would arrive, nor whether he would be able to survive the dangerous journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEAREINKHIVA;An strangely-clothed man has arrived in Khiva from the southern desert, claiming to be a representative from the distant country known as Great Britain. He urges Khan Allah Quli Bahadur to issue an order to release all Russian slaves in our domain so he may bring them across the steppe to the Russian frontier. His reasoning is that Russia is angered by our keeping of the slaves, around 450 in number, and is thus likely to invade us in the near future if we insist on keeping them. Indeed, Russia has on several occasions demanded that we release our Russian slaves. Should we follow the recommendations of this strange man and let him take them to Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARENOTINKHIVA;It has been a long time since Richmond Shakespear set out North from Herat to try to reach Khiva in an attempt to persuade the Sultan to release his Russian slaves, thus depriving the Tsardom of a pretext for war. Sadly, we have heard nothing back from him. He evidently perished on the dangerous journey across the lawless tribal lands on his path North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULRUS;A bedraggled group of 416 former slaves has arrived at one of our forts on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea led by a Brit by the name of Richmond Campbell Shakespear. He claims to have travelled from Herat up the Oxus on a mission to persuade the khan of Khiva to release his Russian slaves, an endeavor which he succeeded in. While morally just and an excellent outcome for the freed slaves, this move on the board of the Great Game was clearly meant by the Brits to deprive us of our reason to invade Khiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULENG;Richmond Campbell Shakespear has arrived on a ship from St. Petersburg to a celebratory welcome in London. After travelling from Herat along the Oxus to Khiva, he met with the Khan who he reports to have been a gentleman, not at all the cruel tyrant he was rumored to be. After some deliberation, the khan agreed to let Shakespear journey across the steppe to the Russian frontier with the slaves. The Russians, while glad to have their people back, were obviously angered to have lost their pretext to invade Khiva. Thanks to Shakespear's heroism, we have gained an edge in the struggle of the Great Game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUBARALSITRI;The Shi'ite cleric Shubar al-Sitri was pushed out Bahrain today after a failed coup attempt to bring the country under Persia's sphere of influence. He had gathered weapons from the northern Arabian towns al-Hasa and Qatif to do so, then attempted to negotiate a collaboration with the Persian Shah, Nasser al-Din Qajar. But while al-Sitri was given support from the Shah, he failed to receive enough manpower due to Persia's preoccupation with contesting the European powers and maintaining internal stability. The failed coup, nevertheless, brought much bloodshed, with scores of Bedouin tribesmen fleeing to Qatar for refuge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VICEROYMAYODED;Richard Burke, 6th Earl of Mayo, the Viceroy of India, was assassinated today in Port Blair, Andaman Islands, during an inspection of the port's penal settlement. The assassin was a convict there, named Sher Ali Afridi, a Punjabi veteran of the British Army serving life in prison for murdering a relative during a feud. His murder of Lord Mayo was part of his plan to avenge his incarceration by killing two high-ranking British officials, since he thought the life sentence was too severe. Lord Mayo's body is being prepared for its return to his native Ireland, while Afridi awaits execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEATHHAWYARD;News has reached us that George W. Hayward was murdered while passing through Chitral. He was on his way north to map the desolate Pamir mountains. Officials had warned him of the danger awaiting him in many of the lawless areas he would pass through, but he proceeded anyway, even carrying with him expensive gifts for Pamiri rulers to endear them to the Brits. These gifts would also, however, make him a target. After passing through Chitral and entering the mountains to the north, Hayward was said to have been ambushed by Chitrali tribesmen who murdered him in cold blood and looted his gifts. They were said to have been delivered to the amir of Chitral, who is rumored to have been complicit in the killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARTKIDNAPPED;Reports have reached us about yet another humiliating loss of a British diplomat in our interminable quest to win the upper hand in Central Asia. Colonel Charles Stoddart has been kidnapped and imprisoned on orders of Emir Nasrullah Khan of Bukhara. Initially dispatched to negotiate a treaty of friendship with Britain and the release of Russian prisoners, Stoddart was taken utterly by surprise by his arrest. We suspect Nasrullah wishes to use Stoddart as a pawn to persuade Britain to leave Central Asia. We can send in another diplomat to plea for Stoddart's release, though it's unlikely we could negotiate it and still keep a good standing in Bukhara. Captain Arthur Conolly would do for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARKLLD;Our bid to rescue Charles Stoddart has come to a tragic end. Failing to negotiate Stoddart's release, Captain Arthur Conolly has himself been arrested, and both men have been beheaded for spying for Britain. Stoddart was put through hell over his time in prison, kept in a twenty-foot-deep hole infested with vermin with other common criminals. The conditions of his imprisonment changed with the Emir's fickle mind, which in turn flip-flopped as he estimated Britain's power in Central Asia, then abused Stoddart accordingly when we were at a geopolitical disadvantage. The pleas of Britain, Russia, the Ottomans, and even Khiva and Kokand could not persuade the Emir to release him. May both men rest in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;

TASHKENTJERUSSIA;Sometimes mutiny can be for the better. General Mikhail Cherniaev has acted against our order not to advance on Tashkent, sieging it over two days despite a stiff defense.

Nevertheless, we should replace him to ensure our future orders are followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALE;After a French cargo ship carrying 98 tons of goods capsized off the coast of Salé, Morocco, a few tons of the cargo were salvaged and stored in Salé itself. For us to have believed these goods would be kept safe, though, was foolish: the locals are scavenging the goods with abandon with little interference from Moroccan authorities. This is a clear act of piracy and merits punishment. All we have to do is say the words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEMOR;The French have voiced outrage at locals in Salé for alleged piracy. After one of their cargo ships capsized and some of its goods were transported to the city, residents began to loot them with minimal interference from our authorities. France demands compensation, which if denied would mean a strong military action from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEREPAID;Morocco has agreed to compensate us for the stolen goods. We have no more of a quarrel with them for now, though let it be clear that we will exact concessions from them if they ever challenge our authority again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TROLLINGINSALE;Morocco has refused to compensate us for the stolen goods. They have no business escalating this tension, should they not wish to have our military unleashed upon them. Their wrongs must be made right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVENGEFORSALE;France has heavy-handedly responded to our refusal to compensate them, navally bombarding Salé as revenge. With the only thing preventing their military from descending on us like demons out the gates of hell being their restraint, we are totally at Paris's mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRETEONEEIGHTFOURONE;While we squabble with the Egyptians over our borders, calls for the reunification of the Greek island of Crete with the Greek mainland have been growing louder. Cretans have petitioned the Great Powers to sponsor a revolt for their independence, most notably Britain, who is rumored to have designs on the island to expand their naval presence in the Mediterranean. Undeservedly confident in their odds of liberation, a revolt has erupted in Crete--one which, needless to say, must be smothered in its infancy before it becomes too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An economic boom has begun, bringing much wealth and prosperity to the now flowering town of Staßfurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

india_je_russia_title;The Duhamel Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
india_je_russia_desc;General Alexander Osipovich Duhamel proposes a radical response to the war with Britain: an invasion of British India. The plan would involve a primary route through Persia and Afghanistan into India by means of the Khyber Pass, which leads into the Peshawar Valley. Duhamel hopes that Russia could build an alliance with the Sikh Empire and prod the locals into a rebellion against the British, particularly the Muslims of Northern and Western India. The plan also has seven alternate routes that make use of passage through Persia and the Turkic sultanates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIA;Russia has formally requested access to our territory in hopes of passing through to India for an invasion. Such an invasion is part of its campaign against the British in the Crimean War: Russia intends to create a new front for them to relieve their siege on the Russian mainland. Should we accept, though, it could mean allowing Russia to build influence in our country without any restraint due to the great powers' intervention. Our people surely would not approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAACCEPTS;Our request to $FROM$ has been accepted: we now may turn the war's tide by invading India. We will bring Britannia to its knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAREFUSES;Our request to $FROM$ has been denied. Our daring invasion plan must now be put to rest, unless we were to go to war with $FROM$ to force them to change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CANVUONGMOVEMENT;A large-scale rebellion against our rule in Vietnam has broken out. The rebels have christened their effort as the Cân Vuong Movement, with Cân Vuong meaning "Aid the king." With this said, the revolt lacks centralization, no doubt due to the heavy regional autonomy the Kingdom of Vietnam was given prior to our campaign to annex it. Its activities primarily involve regional leaders' troops attacking our forces. Of course, any violence against our noble troops must be met with a devastating response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MISSIONOFTHEVIXEN;The British schooner Vixen was detained today off the Caucasian coast by the Russian brig Ajax. The detention comes as a result of foreign vessels being barred from entry into Turkish waters past the Dardanelles, per the 1830 Treaty of Adrianopole. The Vixen had eight on-board guns and 28,000 pounds of gunpowder confiscated by Russian authorities. The British consul of Constainople, David Urquhart, was on board the schooner as it was captured. \n\nWhen looking between the lines of this incident, however, there is a whole other dimension to it. It seems the Vixen's detention was set up by Urquhart to provoke a conflict with Russia. The native Circassian peoples of the Caucasus have British support for their independence, and their liberation would do a service to British trade with Turkey and around the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SANKINKOTAI;Sankin Kotai is a system obligating all daimyo to have permanent residences in Edo to enforce their fealty to the Shogun. Edo has a reputation for its opulent processions as these men make their daily commutes, with thousands of nobles entering and departing the city each day. Dissatisfaction with the Shogun's policies, however, has led to this system becoming less effective, evidenced by how unstable the relationship between the Shogun and daimyo currently is. It is best to have tradition take a back seat and let the daimyo live wherever they wish. They will thank us in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREECEEIGHTEENSIXTYTWO;King Otto, our previous monarch, has been overthrown in a popular revolt. However, the Greek people are not entirely opposed to life under a monarchy. For this reason, the government proposes holding a plebiscite for electing a new king. There are several options we could choose from among the royal families of Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, and Russia. Perhaps a popular monarch hailing from one of the Western European great powers would help us regain Greek land under foreign control. However, it could also bring us into conflict with Europe due to the 1832 London Conference barring Britain, France, and Russia from allowing their royals to claim our throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DANISHKINGGREECE;Prince William of Denmark has gladly accepted the throne! Though not a top choice when our people are surveyed for their preferred candidate, William is uncontroversial and well ingratiated to the great powers. From hereon, he will be known as George I. May his reign be marked by the restoration of Greek sovereignty to our lost territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECE;After deposing Otto I in a popular revolt, Greece has held a plebiscite for electing a new king. As it turns out, the vote's winner has been announced to be our own Prince Alfred of Edinburgh. Alfred is an immensely popular candidate due to the Greeks' conviction that having a British royal on their throne would mean the return of the Ionian Islands, one of our protectorates, to Greek sovereignty.\n\nHowever, his coronation would breach the 1832 London Conference's terms, which prevent any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. Is it in our best interest to violate this pact in the name of goodwill toward Greece?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGREFUSESGREKING;Unfortunately, the United Kingdom has refused to allow Prince Alfred of Edinburgh to be crowned our king. They do so in light of the London Conference of 1832 and the staunch opposition of Queen Victoria herself, whose reasons only God knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECEGRE;Prince Alfred of Edinburgh has accepted the throne! Alfred is by far the most popular choice for King, due to his belonging to the British royal family. Our people hope his coronation will convince Britain to cede us the Ionian Islands, which remain a protectorate of theirs, as well as possibly go to war with us against the Ottomans to liberate other Greek lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECEGPS;Following King Otto's deposition in a popular revolt, Greece has elected Prince Alfred of Edinburgh as the new King of the Greeks. While Alfred boasts huge popularity, his coronation would breach the 1832 London Conference's terms, which prevent any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. This development endangers our economic influence in Greece. It could mean the unification of the British and Greek monarchies, giving them an undeserved advantage in the Mediterranean. We might need to take a strong diplomatic or even military action in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECE;After deposing Otto I in a popular revolt, Greece has held a plebiscite for electing a new king. As it turns out, the vote's winner has been announced to be our own Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich. Nicholas has some support as a claimant due to his Orthodox faith, which most Greeks also follow. Should he be crowned King of Greece, it would bring Russian economic ties to that country closer than ever before. However, it would also violate the 1832 London Conference's stipulation that no British, French, nor German royal may claim the Greek throne. Shall we still honor this pact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSREFUSESGREKING;Unfortunately, Russia has refused to allow Duke Nicholas of Leuchtenberg to be crowned our king. They cite the 1832 London Conference's terms as their reason. We will need to seek other means to fulfill our dream of a fully restored Greece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECEGRE;Grand Duke Nicholas of Leuchtenberg has accepted the Greek throne! His coronation will be a boon to the Orthodox faith, both in Greece and elsewhere. His Russian origin will also bring us closer economically and diplomatically, which can come in handy. Perhaps a Russian alliance is in order?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECEGPS;Following King Otto's deposition in a popular revolt, Greece has elected Duke Nicholas of Russia as the mew King of the Greeks. His Orthodox faith is cited as the primary reason for his candidacy as monarch, since Russia and Greece share Orthodox Christianity as a majority faith. With all this said, his coronation breaches the 1832 London Conference, which bars Britain, France, and Russia from allowing any of their royals from claiming the Greek throne. This development endangers our economic influence in Greece. It could mean the unification of the Russian and Greek monarchies, giving them an undeserved advantage in the Mediterranean. We might need to take a strong diplomatic or even military action in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHKINGGREECE;Jérôme Bonaparte of France has accepted the throne! A member of the the same family line as the famed Napoleon I, his family name carries immense prestige and will be a boon to relations with France. Let us hope this Bonaparte also has some of the military genius his family's patriarch went down in history for. We will need it in our future liberation of all our former lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As it turns out, the vote's winner has been announced to be our own Jérôme Bonaparte. He is supported as a candidate for the crown due to the prestige the Bonaparte name carries. However, his coronation breaches the terms of the 1832 London Conference, which prohibits any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. Shall we still honor the conference's terms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHKINGGREECEGPS;Following King Otto's deposition in a popular revolt, Greece has elected Jérôme Bonaparte of France as the new King of the Greeks. The Greeks have doubtlessly banked on him having some of the same military genius his brother Napoleon I went down in history for. With all this said, his coronation breaches the 1832 London Conference, which bars any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. This development endangers our economic influence in Greece, giving France an undeserved advantage in the Mediterranean. We might need to take a strong diplomatic or even military action in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;

RIYAHDLIBERATION;The Emirates of Jabal Shammar and Nejd historically have been locked in an unending dispute over control of the Arabian desert, though this conflict once again burst into warfare today as Jabal Shammar advanced on the Nejdi capital, Riyadh. This has pushed Nejd's ruling family, the House of Saud, into exile in Kuwait and left Riyadh ripe for annexation. With Jabal Shammar growing so regionally powerful, it is no longer ideal for us to maintain its vassalage and expect them to honor our suzerainty over them. If we do so, it might provoke the Ottomans into a conflict with us over dominance in Arabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAMMARLIBERATION;With our conquest of Nejd, we are now the most powerful emirate in the Arabian Peninsula. For this reason, Egypt has announced the termination of our vassal status under them, fearing that continuing to give us their military and diplomatic support would cause conflict with the Ottomans. Not like this matters to us, though, now that we are independent. If the Ottomans want a fight, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CHANGHUAQUAKE;Destruction has wrought Changhua after a powerful earthquake struck the northwestern Taiwanese county. The tremor has wrought destruction to local houses and temples, claiming about 1,030 lives in the process. Funds must be gathered in order to rebuild this area of central Taiwan, which now resembles a wasteland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAINANQUAKE;Another powerful earthqauke unleashed its wrath on the tropical island of Taiwan, this time in Tainan, Chiayi County. It has resulted in over 1,000 deaths and the collapse of over 8,000 homes. A province with such a volatile environment ought to be invested in further to avoid being run into the ground by these earthquakes. If Taiwan continues to be destroyed by Mother Nature, she will surely never emerge from her reputation as a backwater of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAICHAOCHUEN;The recent rebellions show us that secret societies have immense power within our nation and can easily stir up agitation. The aristocrat Tai Chao Chuen, a member of the Tai clan, has collaborated with other wealthy men to form branches of the Tiandihui, rebelling against Qing rule in response to the society's suppression on the mainland. Redeeming the Qing's legitimacy in these people's eyes is futile--the rabble must be put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWAN;The United States has approached us with an offer to purchase Taiwan. They say having the island under American control would help counter European economic power in Asia and bring the US closer to global dominance. Due to the island being dominated by rural frontiers, inhabited by aboriginals who do not respect our governance, it is tempting to accept the offer. However, can the Americans be trusted to not meddle further in Chinese affairs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWANONE;Formosa is now in American hands! We best get to mining that coal and sulphur right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWANTWO;Formosa remains a Chinese province. We will have to search for riches elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DANANAOINCIDENT;Opium is the scourge of our society, second only to Europeans. The two combined are a plague a million times over. German opium trader James Milisch and his British partner, James Horn, got the government's attention today as it was revealed the two had started a complex operation in Nan'ao, Yilan County, Taiwan. The men made an agreement with local aborigines to set aside land for a private colony, where opium could be produced and traded under the natives' protection. These white men chase profit tenaciously. Let us send a message: the Chinese people will no longer be swindled by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

purchase_taiwan_desc;Commodore Matthew Perry sees great potential for expanding America's influence in East Asia. On his way back from his expedition to Japan, he and his crew docked in Keelung, on the Chinese island of Formosa (known in Chinese as Taiwan), to inspect coal deposits and assess their potential for mining. He reports that the island is both highly lucrative and easily defended, making it a perfect colony. It would also counteract the expansion of European markets in Asia--putting us more prominently on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THELIONHEAD;Our countless internal rebellions over this century prove how quickly our authority disintegrates when challenged. In Taiwan particularly, our administration fails to reign in the local populace, leaving the Taiwanese aboriginals free to live on their tribal land under no Chinese jurisdiction. \n\nWe have dispatched an expedition to forcibly bring civilization to the aboriginals, encountering resistance from the Paiwan tribesmen around Shizi Township and Pingtung County, but ultimately winning an overwhelming victory. A new construction project to solidify a Qing precense in Taiwan has been begun, greatly hindering any attempt by a colonizing country to erase the fact that Taiwan will forever be culturally Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FOURCOUNTIESREB;Taiwan's population is a mix of immigrants from across southern China, with people from different provinces taking on different identities in Taiwanese society. Normally these groups do not experience ethnic tension, but the residents of Mengjia, primarily Minnan immigrants from Quanzhou, now find themselves resistant to building community with new residents moving from nearby Bajiazhuang, who are mostly immigrants from Tong'an. Tensions have escalated between the two over tribalistic community identity. For example, Mengjia residents worship their own patron god at the local temple, whom the Tong'an migrants reject. The two also have competed for docking rights at Mengjia Wharf to trade with the mainland. Soon enough this tension erupted into gang-like violence. Bajiazhuang was burnt down in a riot, and its former residents in Mengjia have been pushed out to settle in Dadaocheng, another coastal suburb.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENT;After four Ryukyuan tributary ships departed from Okinawa, a typhoon caused the ships to change course and led to one being wrecked off western Taiwan, leaving 66 survivors. These men found themselves heading into the territory of the Paiwan aboriginals of Taiwan, where they were robbed and executed. Only twelve survived--they managed to hide from their attackers and were later brought back to the Ryukyus to testify to our government about the incident. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTQNG;After four Ryukyuan tributary ships departed from Okinawa, a typhoon caused the ships to change course and led to one being wrecked off western Taiwan, leaving 66 sailors stranded. These men found themselves heading into the territory of the Paiwan aboriginals of Taiwan, where they were robbed and executed. Only twelve survived--they managed to hide from their attackers and were later brought back to the Ryukyus.\n\nJapan is demanding compensation for these sailors' deaths, despite how the Ryukyus are not Japanese territories and, in fact, are one of our tributaries. Additionally, our administration has made little effort to bring the Taiwanese aboriginals under Chinese rule, and they can therefore be dismissed as outside our state's control--eliminating our need to take responsibility. Nevertheless, how should we respond to Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTONE;$FROM$ has agreed to compensate us for the sailors' deaths. Now, the question is: how can we get lure China into conflict again so we can conquer Taiwan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTTWO;$FROM$ has refused to compensate us for the sailors' deaths. They assert that, as non-Han subjects of their empire living in isolated tribal land, they are "outside the realm of civilization." Therefore, the Chinese state exerts no control over them and cannot be held responsible for their actions. Perhaps we must make them pay at gunpoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTNOWAR;Despite their anger at our refusal to pay an indemnity, Japan does not wish to escalate this incident to war. We respect their decision--it certainly was a smart one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTWAR;Japan has declared war over our refusal to pay an indemnity over the 54 executed Ryukyuan sailors. It seems they will have the whole island of Taiwan before they let China off for these aborigines' crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HEICUOTEMPLE;Today, Qing troops led by Lin Zexu marched over to Heicuo Temple, a Tibetan Buddhist temple in Amdo, to crush an anti-Qing rebel group congregating there. The soldiers worked with unfettered brutality: they burnt the temple to the ground, raized the nearby village, and massacred rebels and civilians alike. We will watch with anticipation how the everpresent Tibetan resistance reacts to this event--and their realization of how easily their resistance to the Qing's might crumbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LINZEXUOPIUM;Under the guidance of administrator Lin Zexu, Qing officials are beginning a confiscation of all opium trafficked on the Pearl River bank in Humen, Dongguan. The confiscation has already drawn up several hundred tons of opium unloaded from British cargo ships. \n\nThe Emperor has ordered that every person caught partaking in the opium trade in China shall be executed. With the side effects of the drug being so severe, including death from withdrawal, it is the least we can do right this injustice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SLAVERYOUTPORTUGAL;Following a treaty between between us for the joint suppression of the slave trade, the United States and Britain have started pressuring our government to outlaw slavery. Refusing would severely endanger our centuries-long alliance with the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
GREATVERMONTFLOOD;During an average monthly rainfall 150% above normal in the state, Vermont has been hit by a flood that is engulfing much of its buildings and streets. The flood also has destroyed infrastructure that the state government has failed to provide funds to repair, creating tension between local politicians and residents. It is estimated that Vermont's towns received on average more than six inches of rain during the flood so far. Somerset is bearing the worst, at one point experiencing a whopping 9.86 inches on record.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RAKOVICAREVOLT;The Croatian politician Eugen Kvaternik, founder of the nationalist Party of Rights, was executed today for inciting a rebellion to liberate Croatia from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. After marching with sympathizers through villages such as Rakovica, Brocanac, and Dreznik, Kvaternik led an attack on the guarded village of Plaski to create a contiguous line of Croatian land that would join his independence movement. In response, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government sent in a regiment to deal with the rebels, promptly arresting Kvaternik and other high-level participants. Such is the fate of nationalist movements in large empires: they hit hard, then fall harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FENIANRAIDSNAMERICA;As if the feud between Britain and its brutally subjugated domain of Ireland could not get worse, America itself has been caught in the fray. An Irish Republican terrorist group called the Fenian Brotherhood, consisting of Irish-American immigrants, launched incursions into Canada to attack British Army forts, attempting to pressure us to withdraw from their homeland. Several raids were launched in Canada East, Canada West, and New Brunswick by the Fenian Brotherhood, though each failed to push out our troops entirely. These radicals are willing to start a guerrilla war and drag the United States into it by having it serve as their home of operations. It's certainly a relief that they are too incompetent to actually accomplish their goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KRIVOSIJEUPRISING;With the Wehrgesetz (Defence Act) being extended to the mountainous region of Krivošije, north of Kotor, fighting has broken out between our troops and the tribesmen inhabiting the area. With help from their compatriots in Montenegro and some bands from Herzegovina, the Krivošije rebels have defeated the several detachments sent against them, humiliating the army and strengthening the rebels' resolve. The conflict has been resolved via a peace treaty, which was signed at Knežlaz, with the rebels officially surrendering to General Rodic but being allowed to keep their weapons and pardoned for their revolt. With the conscription intended by the Wehrgesetz abandoned, the campaign has brought us nothing but humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ELLENACOLONY;Two American businessmen, Joseph Torrey and Thomas Harris, have erected a small farming colony along the coast of the remote island of Borneo. Named the “Ellena Colony," it aims to make a profit through the export of sugarcane. However, the spread of tropical diseases such as malaria through the colony have spelled financial disaster, and its owners seek to sell it. Although it is a significant investment, an American presence in the East Indies could have its rewards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELLENACOLONYAUS;German adventurer and businessman Baron von Overbeck has offered us the chance to purchase a large and remote colony on the northern coast of Borneo.

Anyone with a conviction that slavery must be gone from Cuba, whipped until near death. \n\nSpanish authorities, zealous in their crackdown on potential participants in a slave rebellion, whether it be actually be planned or not, have begun a campaign of terror against the Cuban population. Reports have been received that civilians are being rounded up by Spanish soldiers and then tied to a ladder, where they would be helpless against the oncoming flurry of lashings. \n\nNon-Cubans have also been implicated in the alleged conspiracy.
