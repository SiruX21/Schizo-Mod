option_disable_bankruptcy_events_title;Option: Disable the Bankruptcy Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_bankruptcy_events_desc;Disabling the Bankruptcy events will stop you from getting the CB and effects that happen when a country goes bankrupt on you. It won't stop the event for the AI nor will stop countries going bankrupt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enable_options_title;Show 'Options' Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enable_options_desc;This decision shows all optional decisions to tweak and change the game's behavior from vanilla GFM. This, along with all decisions it enables, will disappear January 1st 1837 to reduce clutter, so you have a year in-game to pick and choose what you want. Once a tweak is chosen, you can't disable it anymore, so if you misclick you need to edit your save or start a new game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_options_title;Hide 'Options' Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_options_desc;This will hide all optional tweaks to vanilla GFM. You still have until 1837 to change your mind though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_radicals_title;Option: Disable Anarcho-Liberal Ideology;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_radicals_desc;This tweak will stop anarcho-liberal ideology from spawning. It may help performance a bit. Some people think they are too unrealistic for them, so they might want to disable it. I didn't test any balance issues that might arise without them in the game though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_workplace_events_title;Option: Disable Workplace Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_workplace_events_desc;A few province events related to the workplace, such as "The Old Man and the Sea", "All the Tea in PROVINCENAME" and "Blood and Iron Mine" can get quite spammy. I increased the MTTH and tried to balance it out, adding more requirements, but if you still find it spammy, you can use this option to completely disable them. Keep in mind that I didn't test balance with these events disabled or anything like this, and this might help improve performance a little bit. A few events that only trigger because you have no or low workplace safety standards are still in though. Pass workplace reforms if you want to get rid of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_microstates_title;Option: Disable Microstates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_microstates_desc;Activate this if you do not want the Microstates of Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco in the game. Just note I haven't really tested it out, but it removes the cores of those countries and just annexes them to the nearest country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_colonial_railroading_title;Option: Disable Colonial Railroading;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_colonial_railroading_desc;This tweak will disable the colonial railroading events in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_trade_policy_globally_title;Option: Disable Trade Policy Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disable_trade_policy_globally_desc;The trade policy decisions helps the AI save more money and help historically heavily protectionist countries (like the US, Russia) to do what they did historically and levy heavy tariffs on imports. They happen once every 10 years (sometimes they are rescinded earlier though) and the AI has full autonomy to pick one of the several choices (so no behaviour is guaranteed). If you'd like to disable this for some reason, you can do it with this option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_hpm_crisis_title;Option: Enable Crisis from the Start;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_hpm_crisis_desc;In HPM, crisis only start after 1870 and after Revolution and Counter-revolution is researched and an event fires. This is to stop stuff like free Ireland in 1840 because of the militancy that the famine generates, among other weird crisis. Selecting this option will remove these restrictions and make crisis happen from the start of the game, like it happens in Vanilla Victoria 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
